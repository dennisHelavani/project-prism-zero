    question: "Can I use my own custom templates?",
    answer: "In MVP we use a standardized branded template. Uploading your own templates is planned for Phase 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle legacy forms?",
    answer: "We map the MVP sections to a consistent structure. Contract- or client-specific forms are part of Phase 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does approval and e-signature work?",
    answer: "MVP delivers documents by email for review. E-signature and routing (e.g., DocuSign/SharePoint) are planned for Phase 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where is our data stored?",
    answer: "Form submissions are processed via Make.com and the output is emailed. Minimal run metadata is retained for troubleshooting and quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the onboarding time?",
    answer: "Zero install. Submit the short form and youâ€™ll typically receive your document within ~60 seconds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who maintains data mappings?",
    answer: "Not required in MVP. Field mapping to systems like SharePoint/Procore arrives in Phase 2.",
