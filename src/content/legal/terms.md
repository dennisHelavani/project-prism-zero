# Terms of Service

Welcome to Hard Hat AI (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By using our website and services, including the generation of construction-related documents such as Risk Assessments and Method Statements (RAMS) or Construction Phase Plans (CPP), you agree to the following terms and conditions:

### 1. Services
We provide AI-assisted document generation tools for construction professionals. Our service produces draft documents based on the information you supply. These are not reviewed by a qualified health and safety consultant unless otherwise stated.

### 2. User Responsibilities
By using this service, you acknowledge that:
- You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy, completeness, and legal compliance of any document before using it on a job site or submitting it to any authority.
- You will not submit false, misleading, or unlawful information in any form.
- You will comply with all applicable UK health & safety regulations (e.g. HSE, CDM 2015).

### 3. Use of AI
Documents are generated using AI technology (e.g. OpenAI’s GPT models). While we aim to provide accurate and relevant content, outputs may not be 100% accurate or suitable for every project. You must review and amend as needed.

### 4. Payments & Refunds
You agree to pay the posted fee for each monthly subscription purchased. Due to the nature of digital content, all sales are final. Refunds are not available once a document has been delivered unless a technical fault prevents delivery.

### 5. Intellectual Property
All content on this website (excluding user submissions) is the intellectual property of Hard Hat AI and may not be copied or reproduced without permission.

### 6. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss, damage, or penalty arising from the use or misuse of our documents or services. You use all materials at your own risk.

### 7. Privacy
Your data will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy (see link below). We will never share your information with third parties without your consent, except where required by law.

### 8. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after updates implies your acceptance.
